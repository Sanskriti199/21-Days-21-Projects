# 21 Days · 21 Projects

This repository documents my **21-day hands-on journey** through **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI**, where I build **one real-world project each day**.

It serves as a single, organized place to track my learning, experiments, and end-to-end AI projects — all pushed consistently as I progress.

## What This Repository Contains

- Machine Learning projects covering prediction, classification, and segmentation tasks
- Deep Learning implementations using CNNs, transfer learning, and time-series models
- Generative AI applications such as OCR systems, Text-to-SQL models, RAG-based chatbots, and AI agents
